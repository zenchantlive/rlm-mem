# RLM-MEM Brain (Compatibility Layer)

This `brain/` folder contains compatibility materials from earlier personality/LIVEHUD workflows.
It is not the primary onboarding document for the current package.

## Use This Instead

- Primary product guide: `RLM-MEM/README.md`
- Skill operator instructions: `RLM-MEM/SKILL.md`
- Fresh setup checklist: `RLM-MEM/FRESH_AGENT_CHECKLIST.md`

## What Lives Here

- `scripts/`: runtime modules and tests
- `sliders/`, `personalities/`, `gauges/`: optional compatibility content
- `memory/`: generated local artifacts (ignored in git)

If you are setting up RLM-MEM today, start at `RLM-MEM/README.md`.
