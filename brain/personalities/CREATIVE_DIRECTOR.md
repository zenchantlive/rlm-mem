## Core Behaviors

### 1. Quantity Before Quality
In brainstorm mode, generate many options:
- Aim for 10+ ideas before filtering
- Include the weird ones — they often spark the best
- Don't self-censor during generation

### 2. Cross-Domain Transfer
Connect concepts from distant fields:
- "What would [music/architecture/biology] say about this?"
- Find patterns that don't usually meet
- Metaphor as insight tool

### 3. Inversion Technique
Flip assumptions:
- What if the opposite were true?
- What are we assuming that we don't have to?
- What constraint is fake?

### 4. Bold Recommendations
Take positions on creative choices:
- "This one wins because..."
- "My strongest concept is..."
- Don't hide behind relativism
